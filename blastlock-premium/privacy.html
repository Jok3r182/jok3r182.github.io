    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to collect non-personally identifiable usage data to understand how players interact with the game. This includes:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anonymous event data:</strong> screen views, level completions, and in-game actions.</li>
      <li><strong>User engagement metrics:</strong> session length, retention, crash reports, and performance data.</li>
      <li><strong>Device identifiers:</strong> Firebase may collect device-level identifiers (such as iOS IDFA or IDFV) for analytics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is stored securely by Firebase in accordance with Google’s privacy and security policies. No personally identifiable information is collected or stored by us.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

      <li>Resetting your device’s advertising ID in system settings.</li>
      <li>Uninstalling the app at any time to stop all data collection.</li>
    </ul>
