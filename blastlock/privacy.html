    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Matthew Productions</strong> built the game <strong>Blastlock</strong> as a commercial application. This service is provided as is and intended for entertainment purposes.</p>

    <h2>Advertising & Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads. On iOS, you may be asked for permission to allow tracking through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. This is to provide you with more relevant ads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prompt says: <em>"Allow Blastlock to track your activity across apps and websites to provide personalized game recommendations and improve our analytics. Your data remains anonymous and never shared."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose <strong>“Ask App Not to Track”</strong>, only non-personalized ads will be shown.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to collect anonymous data to help us improve the game. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Game progress (levels, scores)</li>
      <li>Feature usage and button taps</li>
      <li>Session length and crashes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personally identifiable information is collected or stored.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Your game progress and settings are saved locally on your device. On Apple devices, data may also be synced to iCloud if enabled in your system settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      This game is not directed toward children under the age of 13. If you believe we have collected data from a child without parental consent, please contact us immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect personal data. All analytics and advertising data are managed securely through Firebase and Google AdMob in compliance with their privacy practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a revised date.
