# Privacy Policy

**Matthew Productions** built this app as a commercial game application. This service is provided by Matthew Productions and is intended for use as is.


## Data Collection

We use **Firebase Analytics** to collect non-personally identifiable usage data to understand how players interact with the game. This includes:

- **Anonymous event data:** Screen views, level completions, button taps, and other in-game actions.
- **User engagement metrics:** Session length, retention, crashes, and performance statistics.

All analytics data is stored in Firebase with Googleâ€™s security practices. No personally identifiable information is ever collected or stored.

## Data Storage

Game progress and settings may be stored locally on your device, or synced to Apple iCloud to allow restoring your progress.

## Security

We value your trust in using our app. No personal data is collected or transmitted to any external servers outside Firebase Analytics.

## Changes

This privacy policy may be updated in the future. Please review this page for any changes.
